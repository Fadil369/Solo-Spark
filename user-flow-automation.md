I'll create a comprehensive **User Journey Automation System** that guides customers from first contact to becoming loyal advocates. Let me design this as a complete automated flow:

## 🚀 User Journey Automation System

### **Stage 1: AWARENESS** 🔍

*First Touch → Interest*

```yaml
Trigger_Points:
  - Website_Visit:
      action: "Deploy exit-intent popup"
      offering: "Free PRD Template Guide"
      language: "Auto-detect (Arabic/English)"

  - Social_Media_Engagement:
      platforms: ["LinkedIn", "Twitter", "Instagram"]
      action: "Retargeting pixel activation"
      followup: "Send DM with resource link"

  - Content_Discovery:
      blog_posts: "Track reading time > 30 seconds"
      action: "Show contextual CTA"
      personalization: "Based on content topic"

Automation_Flow:
  1. Capture_Lead:
     - Email/Phone collection
     - WhatsApp opt-in (Saudi preference)
     - Tag with source & interest

  2. Instant_Welcome:
     - Send welcome message (< 5 minutes)
     - Deliver lead magnet
     - Schedule follow-up sequence

  3. Nurture_Sequence:

    competitor_comparison: {
      detect: "comparison_keywords",
      action: "Highlight unique features",

    }
  },

  automated_responses: {
    chatbot: {
      greeting: "مرحباً! كيف يمكنني مساعدتك؟ | Hi! How can I help?",
      qualification: ["budget", "timeline", "use_case"],
